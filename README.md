These scripts have been created for analysing the diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Dementia Prevention Research Clinic (DPRC), at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. 


Please read manuals (.docx files) to learn more about the scripts generated for the DPRC dMRI data analysis. Specific diffusion analysis include preprocessing/cleaning dMRI data, constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), fixel-based analysis (FBA), and creating a structural connectome. Scripts are written in Matlab 2019, as a wrapper which calls commands from MRtrix3 (Tournier et al., 2019), FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (Jenkinson, Beckmann, Behrens, Woolrich, & Smith, 2012), and Advanced Normalisation Tools (ANTs) (Avants et al., 2011) (these must all be installed for use). 


Please visit websites of the above software programmes and cite the original authors of the programme, if you wish to use this.
